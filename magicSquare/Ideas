- 3x3 matrix s, range 1-9
- cost |a-b| to convert a to b
- find min cost

xxx  i-1,j-1  i,j-1  i+1,j-1 -> s[0]
xox  i-1,j    i,j    i+1,j   -> s[1]
xxx  i-1,j+1  i,j+1  i+1,j+1 -> s[2]

what is needed to do: 
1. check if s is magic square
2. if s is, return 0
3. if s is not, change numbers
    - find column, row, diagRight, diaLeft values
        - find duplicates/ find differences to get magic const
        - change num accordingly, update cost
finding of matrix:
1.1+2=..+9 =45, since row/col has to be equal, 45/3
        
- All 8 of those combinations need to appear in the square as a row, column or diagonal. The centre cell must appear in the middle row, middle column and both diagonals. So it must be a number that appears four times, only number is 5

- 5 must be at the centre

- For corners, it has to be appear in row, col, diagnol, so it appears three times. 
9 5 1
7 5 3
2 5 8
4 5 6
2 9 4
6 1 8
6 7 2
8 3 4
combination add up to 15. so 2,4,6,8

To find all cases, use mirror and rotation
